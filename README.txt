installed postgresql on windows 
used pgAdmin to create dogbook db

add Users table to dogbook db
	created columns id, name
	added two entries to table

in express, used sequelize auto to use db schemas to create models 
	****** THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING ****
		you should create a script for this to run automatically
		you can create this script in package.json "npm create db"

connected app to db using sequelize.

now you have access to Model and db data.
